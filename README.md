# GDSC-InfCube
In this game you race against the map ie. the map behind you falls apart as you keep moving forward but one wrong step and you fall off into the abyss. I have used the Unity game engine and written the code in C#. I have also used Blender, VSCode and Gimp. 

The game uses the rigidbody system of unity to make the falling the effect of the map while the player uses the character controller. I used character controller for the player to have precise movement as using rigidbody and addForce system would make it slightly unpredictable for the player. 

This game is a infinte runner ie. it has no end goal. In the future I would love to add a global leaderboard system using google play services, shop system to buy cosmetics for the character.
